  "description": "In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, my guest is Dr. Alia Crum, PhD, professor of psychology at Stanford University and the director of the Stanford Mind & Body Lab.\n\nDr. Crum explains that our mindsets—for example, what we believe about stress, exercise and the food we eat—shape how we feel, behave and even how our bodies respond. We discuss studies showing simply believing a food is indulgent can shift satiety hormones and that viewing your daily activity as real exercise can improve weight loss and health markers. We also discuss how to reframe stress so it becomes a tool for growth and improved performance.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/rTtaOnp\n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past full-length Huberman Lab episodes.

  "description": "My guest is ⁠Alex Honnold⁠, a professional rock climber considered by many to be one of the greatest athletes of all time for his historic ⁠free solo⁠ (no ropes or man-made holds) ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite. We discuss how to envision massive goals in any part of life and the process of breaking down those goals into actionable daily steps. Alex shares how embracing your uniqueness and mortality is the most powerful way to envision and live a fuller, more intentional life. We also discuss strength and endurance training, assessing risk and how Alex prepares mentally and physically for extreme challenges. We also discuss how to balance goal-seeking with family and work. Regardless of your goals, profession or age, this conversation will very likely reshape how you think about and approach your life, goals and potential.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/6RNPzxY\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nMaui Nui: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nFunction: https://functionhealth.com/huberman\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Alex Honnold*\nWebsite: https://www.alexhonnold.com\nClimbing Gold (podcast): https://www.climbinggold.com\nAlone on the Wall (book): https://amzn.to/3I05vxD\nHonnold Foundation: https://www.honnoldfoundation.org/#mission \nTED talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iM6M_7wBMc&t=1s \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwqnNQOiZzpPNazMN0cBAzw \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alexhonnold\nX: https://x.com/alexhonnold \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AlexHonnold\n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 Alex Honnold\n00:02:17 Intrinsic & Extrinsic Motivation, Setting Big Goals\n00:05:00 Preparing for Free Solo of El Capitan, Route Memorization & Conditions\n00:10:09 Sponsors: Joovv & BetterHelp\n00:12:35 Overthinking, Kinesthetic Flow; Climbing & Surprise \n00:16:24 Aging & Climbing; Olympics & Broadening Climbing Culture; Parkour\n00:23:04 Grip Strength, Aging, Climbing Technique, Yosemite National Park, Half Dome\n00:29:00 Free Soloing & Rope Climbing, Safety & Risk; Aging & Death; Mentors\n00:38:32 Sponsors: AG1 & Maui Nui\n00:41:29 Climbing Lifestyle, Training, Career; Recovery\n00:47:44 Technology, Smartphones & Distraction from Goals, Focus\n00:51:09 Pursuing Ambitious Goals, Tool: Small Daily Challenges\n00:55:56 Fear, Brain Scan & Public Speaking; Evaluating Risk\n00:59:40 Doing What You Love, Life Crisis, Tool: Contemplating Death\n01:03:49 Childhood, Passion & Choosing Career Path; University\n01:11:46 Sponsor: Function\n01:13:34 Outdoor Exploration, Yosemite, National Parks, Rucking, Trail Running\n01:18:18 Girl Climber Film, Effort & Dedication\n01:23:29 Strength Training, Pull-Ups, Muscle-Ups, Tool: Increase Sets & Reduce Soreness\n01:31:59 Endurance & Strength Training Schedule; Posture; Running\n01:38:52 Body Balance, Leanness; Muscle Cramps; Multi-Day Climbs\n01:42:31 Awe in Nature, Spiritual Experiences; How Geckos Climb; Cliff-Dwelling Wildlife\n01:46:46 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

  "description": "My guest is ⁠Dr. David DeSteno, PhD⁠, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University. We discuss science, God and religion, including what science can and can’t reveal about the existence of God and where religious faith and science do and do not align. We also discuss why questions about life’s origins, miracles and the afterlife have persisted across time. Dr. DeSteno explains how religious rituals cause meaningful improvements in mental and physical health and how prayer and gratitude can markedly reduce stress, increase honesty and compassion and buffer against loneliness and despair. Finally, we explore what distinguishes religions and mission-based communities from cults, and we discuss the role that communities such as 12-step and Burning Man play in modern life.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/wXf7nNR\n\n*Thank you to our sponsors*\nAG1: ⁠https://drinkag1.com/huberman⁠\nOur Place: ⁠https://fromourplace.com/huberman⁠\nLMNT: ⁠https://drinklmnt.com/huberman⁠\nEight Sleep: ⁠https://eightsleep.com/huberman⁠\nFunction: ⁠https://functionhealth.com/huberman⁠\n\n*Follow Huberman Lab*\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab \nThreads: https://www.threads.net/@hubermanlab\nX: https://twitter.com/hubermanlab \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-huberman\nWebsite: https://www.hubermanlab.com \nNewsletter: https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter\n\n*Dr. David DeSteno*\nWebsite: https://davedesteno.com\nNortheastern University academic profile: https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/david-desteno\nHow God Works (book): https://amzn.to/4njja27\nHow God Works (Podcast): https://www.howgodworks.org\nBooks: https://amzn.to/3HRWIhh\nGoogle Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-kiWT4AAAAJ \nX: https://x.com/daviddesteno \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/howgodworkspod\nBlueSky: https://bsky.app/profile/daviddesteno.bsky.social \nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-desteno-016ab6110 \n\n*Timestamps*\n00:00:00 David DeSteno\n00:02:10 Science & Belief in God, Does God Exist?\n00:07:06 Universe Origins & Scientific Questions; Religion & Life/Health Benefits\n00:15:16 Sponsors: Our Place & LMNT\n00:18:23 Russell's Teapot, “Overbelief”, Faith; Religio-prospecting, Traditional Practices\n00:26:49 Mediation & Compassion, Prayer & Stress Relief, Tools: Meditation, Prayer\n00:34:40 Superstition, Prayers & Rituals; Mourning Rituals, Eulogies, Shiva, Connection\n00:43:58 Grieving & Different Religious Traditions\n00:47:15 Sponsors: AG1 & Eight Sleep\n00:50:12 God vs Religion?; Prayer, Community, Religious Rituals & Ideals\n00:56:17 Psychedelics, Ego Death, Right vs Left-Handed Roots\n01:01:24 Good & Evil; Lies & Cheating; Gratitude & Prayer\n01:11:03 Loneliness, Community & Religion, Relationship with God & “3AM Friend”\n01:16:25 Sponsor: Function\n01:18:12 Feeling God; Intelligent Design, Evolution, Eye; Awe\n01:25:21 Overwhelm & Spiritual Experiences, Awe Despite Understanding\n01:31:01 Fear of Death, Afterlife, Tool: Contemplating Death\n01:37:11 Time Perception, Connectedness, Traditional Practices\n01:42:53 Addiction; 12-Step Programs & Surrender to a Higher Power\n01:49:02 New Religions, Burning Man, Modern Spiritual Experiences, Cults\n01:58:06 Cults vs Religions, Religious Interpretation & Reorientation \n02:03:56 AI, Technology, Religion & Intelligence; Religious “Branding”\n02:11:05 Religion Figures & Flaws, Direct Experience of God\n02:15:13 Finding a Belief System, Embracing Religious Practices, Tool: Sampling Religions\n02:21:40 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter\n\nDisclaimer & Disclosures: https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer",

  "description": "In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, my guest is Dr. Craig Heller, PhD, a professor of biology at Stanford University and a world expert on the science of temperature regulation.\n\nWe discuss how the body and brain regulate temperature in different conditions and why conventional cooling methods, such as placing ice packs on the neck, do not effectively reduce core body temperature. Dr. Heller explains why cooling glabrous skin areas—the palms, soles and upper face—efficiently releases body heat and can significantly enhance physical performance and endurance. We discuss how targeted palmar cooling improves both short-term performance and long-term training adaptation in aerobic and anaerobic exercise.\n\nEpisode show notes: https://go.hubermanlab.com/aERGXSD\n\nHuberman Lab Essentials are short episodes focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past full-length Huberman Lab episodes.
